## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### Project 1: Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine Learning
- **Description**: Developed a robust machine learning model to predict heart
disease risk. Leveraged scikit-learn for model building and
pandas for data manipulation and analysis. Employed MLflow for
tracking experiments and model management, and Optuna for
hyperparameter optimization to enhance model performance.
Built an interactive user interface with Streamlit to provide realtime predictions and visualizations

- **Technologies Used**: Pandas , Seaborn , scikit-learn , Optuna , Mlflow ,streamlit
